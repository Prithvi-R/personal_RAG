# Matrix Notes

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Each element of a matrix is identified by its row and column position.

Matrices can be classified into different types. A **square matrix** has the same number of rows and columns. A **diagonal matrix** is a type of square matrix where all the elements outside the main diagonal are zero. An **identity matrix** is a special diagonal matrix with ones on the diagonal.

The **transpose** of a matrix is obtained by flipping it over its diagonal, turning rows into columns and vice versa. The **determinant** is a scalar value that can be computed from a square matrix and gives information about the matrix's properties, such as whether it is invertible.

If a matrix has an inverse, multiplying the matrix by its inverse results in the identity matrix. Not all matrices have inverses; only those with non-zero determinants do.

**Eigenvalues** are special numbers associated with a square matrix that provide insight into its transformation characteristics. They are found by solving a characteristic polynomial derived from the determinant.

The basic operations on matrices include addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication. Matrix multiplication is only possible when the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second.

Matrices are widely used in linear algebra, computer graphics, data science, and machine learning to represent and transform data.
